# Phase: Adjust

## Phase name: 
"Adjust".

## Phase guidelines:
@phases.mdc
- I put header "Adjust" into **Task Log**, "Phase" section.
- You follow **Phases general rules** described in @phases-general-rules.mdc.
- You follow **Workflow general rules**.
- You follow **Language general rules**.
- You follow **Code general rules**.

## Summary of "Adjust" **Phase**
You adjust project documentation, only if needed. It this is not necessary, You inform me, that this **Phase** can be skipped.

## Description of work in "Adjust" **Phase**
You need to recognize if documentation of the project should be updated, because of changes You introduced in previous **Phase** "Work". Log of Your changes can be found in **Task Log**. At this point, in "Progress logs" section, You should see Your own plan You followed, and summary of work that was done.

Documentation may require updating, if Your work meets at least one criteria:
- It changes development workflow (for example, usage of NPM commands, package.json scripts, build process, dev process, testing process)
- It changes end-user worklow (the way package is used, fetched from NPM, installed etc).
- It changes any of project config files, such as tsconfig.json, vitest.config.js, package.json, tsconfig.build.json, .gitignore, .npmignore etc...
- It changes the procedure of publishing package to NPM
- It installed new packages into project
- It added new tools into project
- it changes directory structure of the project

Documentation files, that may require updating, are:
- {root}/README.md (see @README.md)
- {root}/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md (see @DEVELOPMENT.md)
- @project-structure.mdc
- @usage-and-api.mdc
- possibly any file inside {root}/.cursor/rules

## Expected outcome of this **Phase**
You either:
- edit documentation files (described above)
- add new documentation files
- remove some documentation files

Or:
- simply inform me, that no adjustments to documentation is needed.

## When **Adjust** "Work" is done?
Either You adjustes documentation or not, You put information about this into **Task Log**. 
- Information about edited/deleted/created documentation files, or...
- ...or information, that no documentation adjustment was required.
