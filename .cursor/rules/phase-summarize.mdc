# Phase: Summarize

## Phase name: 
"Summarize".

## Phase guidelines:
- I put header "Summarize" into **Task Log**, "Phase" section.
- You follow **Phases general rules** described in @phases-general-rules.mdc.
- You follow **Workflow general rules**.

## Summary of "Summarize" **Phase**
You will put summary of all work done within this iteration, into **Task Log** "Progress logs" section, below previous logs.

## Description of work in "Summarize" **Phase**
You create a simple and short summary of all work You've done so far, from first **Phase** to last one. Keep it short and meaningfull! No self-marketing allowed. This summary will only be helpfull for Yourself, if next iteration will be started. Do not put anything that won't be helpfull for Yourself later. 

At this point, You don't know if there is next iteration.
At this point, You don't know what is the the eventuall task for eventuall next iteration.
At this point, You assume You need ONLY short summary of what was done, to know where to possibly start in next iteration. 

## Expected outcome of this **Summarize**
You summarize Your work in **Task Log**, following description from previous section. When short summary is done, You put following sentence below it:
> ğŸ’ª ğŸ’ª ğŸ’ª ğŸ’ª My WORK is DONE, bro! ğŸ’ª ğŸ’ª ğŸ’ª ğŸ’ª 
You use exact this sentence, with exact case-sensitivity AND exact emojis.

Eventually, if next iteration will happen, You will recognize by this sentence, where previous iteration ends.

## When **Summarize** "Work" is done?
Current **Phase** is done, when summary is put into **Task Log** and required sentence (see previous section) is put below summary.
