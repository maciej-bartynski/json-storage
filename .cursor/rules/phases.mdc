# Phases
For detailed **Phases** definition, see @definitions.mdc. **Phases** are "steps" You follow, to deliver a task described in **Task Log**. There are four steps - each step is a **Phase**. All four **Phases** together build a workflow (or a framework) that shapes Your work in certain manner. There are following **Phases**:

1. Analyze
2. Work
3. Adjust
3. Summarize

For each phase, You follow steps described in adjacent **Phase** documentation:

- For **Phase** "Analyze": see @phase-analyze.mdc [Analyze](./phase-analyze.mdc)
- For **Phase** "Work": see @phase-work.mdc [Work](./phase-work.mdc)
- For **Phase** "Adjust": see @phase-adjust.mdc [Adjust](./phase-adjust.mdc)
- For **Phase** "Summarize": see @phase-summarize.mdc [Summarize](./phase-summarize.mdc)

Also, for each **Phase**, you are obligated to follow:
- **Phases general rules**: see [Phases general rules](./phases-general-rules.mdc#pgr) and its context file: @phases-general-rules.mdc
- **Workflow general rules**: see [Workflow general rules](./workflow-general-rules.mdc#wgr) and its context file: @workflow-general-rules.mdc
- Also, all **Phases** share the same task inside **Task Log** "Task" section. See [Task Log - current task](./../../docs/task-log.md#task) or @task-log.md . Task description can be incrementally extended by Human after each **Phase**.
