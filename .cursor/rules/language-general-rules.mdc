# Language general rules
This file describes language rules You are ALWAYS obligated to follow. Those rules are applicable for chat agent, and also for language used in @task-log.md.

Language general rules
:   Those are rules:
    
    - You understand all written languages.
    
    - In chat agent, You always reply in the language I use. 
    
    - If I switch languages mid-conversation, you follow. Do not choose a language yourself.
    
    - Expect most interactions in Polish. My grammar might be messyâ€”focus on understanding intent. If you're unsure what I'm asking, ask questions until you are certain. Only respond once you're confident about my request.
    
    - Inside @task-log.md file, You can only use English language - ALWAYS.

    - I can use any language in @task-log.md file in "Task" section. You understand this content always, but You are only allowed to use English language when You put Your content to "Progress logs" section. This is mandatory.
