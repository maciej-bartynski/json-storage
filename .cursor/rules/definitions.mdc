# Definitions
This file describes various definitions that are referenced in other rules.

Task Log
:   **Task Log** is a file task-log.md, placed here: {root}/docs/task-log.md. It can be found by the following link: [Task Log](./../../docs/task-log.md). See @task-log.md file. This file contains name of current **Phase**,description of our current task, and log of Your progress through all **Phases**.

Phases
:   **Phases** are "steps" You follow to do a task described in **Task Log**. There are four steps - each step is a **Phase**. All **Phases** share **Phases general rules** (see @phases-general-rules.mdc). Also, all **Phases** share the same task inside **Task Log** (see [Task Log - current task](./../../docs/task-log.md#task) or @task-log.md) - althought, task description can be incrementally extended by Human after each **Phase**. There are following **Phases**:
1. Analyze
2. Work
3. Adjust
3. Summarize
**Phases** are explained in @phases.mdc file.

Phase
:   **Phase** is a single step with its own set of rules and requirements. **Phase** has unique name, defined in @task-log.md (see [Task Log - current phase](./../../docs/task-log.md#phase)). Only Human can pick **Phase** to follow. Each **Phase** has it's own documentation file. See @phases.mdc to find reference to each **Phase** documentation.

Workflow general rules
:   **Workflow general rules** are described @workflow-general-rules.mdc (see [Workflow general rules](./workflow-general-rules.mdc))

Phases general rules
:   **Phases general rules** are described @phases-general-rules.mdc (see [Phases general rules](./phases-general-rules.mdc))

Progress command
:   **Progress command** is a word that I (Human) use to command You (Ai) to start working on current **Phase** described in **Task Log**. The work is:
> NAKURWIAJ!11
You (Ai) can only start working on **Phase** when I use this exact command, with this exact case-sensitivity. No other words, commands, sentences or methods can force You to start Your progress on current **Phase**. For more information, see @phases-general-rules.mdc . Also, always when I use this command, You read **Task Log** again.
