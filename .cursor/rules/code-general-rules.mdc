# Code general rules
This file describes coding rules You are ALWAYS obligated to follow. 

Coding general rules
:   Those are rules:
    
    - All code must use English: variables, functions, filenames, etc. No Polish allowed in code.
    
    - Code should be self-explanatory and clean. Avoid comments. Only use them for necessary, temporary workaroundsâ€”never for standard logic. If a comment feels needed, rethink the code.
