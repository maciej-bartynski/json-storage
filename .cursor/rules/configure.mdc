When exact command 

> Fadro configure

is used, create README.md file and DEVELOPMENT.md file. Do not operate in Phases and do not touch `{root}/docs/task-log.md` file. This is different than "Phase: Adjust" of Fadro workflow. Follow this rules:

1. README.md

- Firstly, index and understand whole codebase.
    - Understand if this is frontend or backend code, understand Javascrip syntax, standard version etc.
    - Understand development flow, especially how to run project, how to refresh project, what tools are required etc.
    - Understand testing flow, especially if it is connected to development flow or build flow, etc.
    - Understand building flow.
    - Understand exposing to production flow.
    - Understand tools used within project.
    - Understand package.json file and all other configuration files for all tools, expecially (but not exclusively) build tools, reloading tools, testing tools etc...
    - Understand many more, expecially (but not exclusively) everything.
- Then, create README.md file only if not exists yet in `{root}/README.md` directory.
- Place it here: `{root}/README.md`
- Put content inside:
    - Summary of what the project is.
    - Summary of how to use this project.
    - Most important informations from perspective of developer who join the team and needs to start working on codebase quickly.
    - All informations that are typically present in README files of projects.
    - Make this content brief, but meaningfull for both:
        - Developer using this project.
        - Developer working on this project.
        - **Ai assistant** working on this project.
- Organize content in understandable, short, meaningful README documentation.
- Do not repeat informations that you plan to store in `{root}/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, if such repeatations are not needed.

2. DEVELOPMENT.md

- Index and understand whole codebase first - AGAIN.
- Create DEVELOPMENT.md file only if not exists yet in `{root}/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` directory.
- Place it here: `{root}/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Put content inside:
    - Project structure
    - Tools necessary to work with this project (prerequisites)
    - Summary of how to work with this project as a developer. Include informations such as:
        - If this is frontend or backend code, understand Javascrip syntax, standard version etc.
        - Development flow, especially how to run project, how to refresh project, what tools are required etc.
        - Testing flow, especially if it is connected to development flow or build flow, etc.
        - Building flow.
        - Exposing to production flow.
        - Tools used within project.
        - Package.json file and all other configuration files for all tools, expecially (but not exclusively) build tools, reloading tools, testing tools etc...
        - How to install this project
        - How to run this project in development mode
        - How to expose this project to production
        - How to run build process
        - How to run testing process
        - What is the development and publishing flow
        - Project config files, especially, but not exclusively: builder, bundler, transpiler, compiler, testing library, testing config file(s), linter, prettier, any other tools 
    - Any other important informations, that **Ai assistant** has to know while working on this codebase.
- Organize content in understandable, short, meaningful instruction.
- Do not repeat informations that you stored `{root}/README.md`, if such repeatations are not needed.
