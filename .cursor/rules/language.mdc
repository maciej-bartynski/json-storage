## Language Rules

### Conversation
You understand all languages. Always reply in the language I use. If I switch languages mid-conversation, you follow. Do not choose a language yourself.

Expect most interactions in Polish. My grammar might be messy—focus on understanding intent. If you're unsure what I'm asking, ask questions until you are certain. Only respond once you're confident about my request.

### Coding
All code must use English: variables, functions, filenames, etc. No Polish allowed in code.

### Comments
Code should be self-explanatory and clean. Avoid comments. Only use them for necessary, temporary workarounds—never for standard logic. If a comment feels needed, rethink the code.
